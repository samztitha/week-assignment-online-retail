# Online Retail Assignment

This is my week assignment for customer purchase insights.  
Dataset: [Online Retail (UCI Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)  

The script (`assignment.py`) does:
- Cleans the data (missing, duplicates, new total column)  
- Analysis: total sales, most sold product, avg order value, unique customers  
- Plots: bar (top 10 products), line (monthly sales), pie (sales by country)  
- Prints 5â€“6 insights at the end
